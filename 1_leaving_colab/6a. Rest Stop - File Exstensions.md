## Lesson 1.6a File Extensions

**Notice how some files end with a dot and letters?** Those are called **file extensions** - they tell your computer (and you) what type of file it is.

**Common extensions you'll see:**

- `.py` - Python code files
- `.md` - Markdown files (like documentation)
- `.txt` - Plain text files
- `.csv` - Data files (spreadsheets)
- `.jpg`, `.png` - Image files
- `.pdf` - Documents

**Nearly all files have these extension**, but Windows and Mac by default hide them, so if you haven't worked with IDEs like VSCode before, extensions might not be something you think about. But they matter.

**The sneaky problem on both Windows and Mac:** You create a file called `app.py`, but your computer secretly saves it with an extra extension.

- **Windows:** Notepad saves it as `app.py.txt`
- **Mac:** TextEdit saves it as `app.py.rtf`

In your file browser, you only see `app.py` because both systems hide extensions by default.
Then when you try to run:
```bash
python app.py
```

You get: `python: can't open file 'app.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory`

**Solution:**
- **Windows:** File Explorer → View → Show → File name extensions
- **Mac:** Finder → Preferences → Advanced → Show all filename extensions

**Or better: always create code files in VS Code (or terminal), not basic text editors** - it won't add surprise extensions.

# Practice

**Your friend sends you a file called `presentation` with no extension. What problem might this cause?**

a) The file will be corrupted 
b) You won't know what program to use to open it 
c) It will take up more storage space 
d) It can't be copied to other computers


**You see a file called `data.csv` in your project. What type of content would you expect to find inside?**

a) Python code 
b) A spreadsheet with rows and columns of data 
c) An image 
d) Documentation text
