This is the first mini-course that is meant to be a part of a bigger journey — AI Engineering in Production, that (I hope) will teach you things that are often not covered in tutorials and introduction to AI online courses.

This whole journey — the series of the courses — is meant to be both structured and comprehensive. Meaning that we’ll begin in the beginning and will grow both our AI Engineering mindset and tool-chain step by step until (hopefully) you feel well oriented in the AI Engineering worlds and can begin exploration on your own.

This course and courses after assume you have _some_ Python knowledge. But we will begin slowly. So, if you forgot or just beginning your Python journey, you should be able to follow.

Often times when people are taught Python (especially if they are taught to use it with data, ML/AI), they are taught to use Google Colab or Jupyter notebooks etc. And there’s a value in it. A lot ML/AI research and data exploration _is_ done in Notebooks. There are many companies even deploy Notebooks into production!

But there’s also the whole world outside of Notebooks. This is the world of wider Python and engineering skills that will make you more flexible as an AI Engineer (skills and career-wise). Personally, I think, it is also more fun to be a part of that wider world. Notebooks are great for exploration and research. But engineering skills let you automate analyses, build applications others can use, and collaborate with software engineers.

So’ let’s begin!

### A little bit about the structure

This course is split into logically-complete sections and each section is split into mini-lessons.

My strong believe is that in order to learn _anything_ in the domain of engineering you absolutely need to get your hands dirty and build some stuff. So in every course we build an app together. In every section we build a meanigful part of that app. And after (nearly) every class you’ll have an opportunity to practice your skills.

## Section 1. Build your first command-line application

### Lesson 1.1 MoodTracker

Welcome to your journey from Jupyter notebooks to professional software development! If you've been living in the comfortable world of `.ipynb` files and Google Colab, this chapter will feel different - and that's exactly the point.

In this chapter, we'll build _MoodTracker_, a command-line application that is grounded in the deeply scientific methodology of Pixar's "Inside Out". It helps users (you) log and analyze their daily emotions. 

This is something that you probably can build easily in Colab or Jupyter. But here's what makes this different what we are going to do from the approach you know:

- **It runs as a standalone program** - just like any application
- **It can run locally on your computer** -- no need to connect to Google Colab
- **It processes command-line arguments** - like professional developer tools
- **It saves data to files** - persistent storage without cloud dependencies
- **It follows engineering patterns** - organized, testable, maintainable code

And! We're not just building a simple script. We're establishing the **engineering mindset** and **professional workflows** that separate research code from production-ready software development. Every choice we make, from how we organize files to how we run programs, follows patterns used by professional engineering teams.

**Why mood tracker specifically??**
1. **It is connecting your analytical background** (tracking and analyzing data) with engineering practices (building applications that others can use).
2. **Simple enough** to focus on tooling and workflow
3. **Complex enough** to demonstrate proper project organization 
4. **Relatable** - everyone has emotions that one can track and maybe even learn something from them
5. **Extensible** - we can grow it into something sophisticated

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a complete development environment and a working command-line application that you can actually use daily.

## The Notebook vs. Engineering Mindset

### What You Know: Data Science Workflow

```python
# In a Jupyter cell
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('emotions.csv')
data.groupby('mood').mean()
# Output appears below cell
```

### What We're Building: Engineering Workflow

```bash
# In the terminal
python mood_logger.py happy 3
python mood_logger.py stats
# Output appears in terminal, data persists between runs
```

**The key difference isn't complexity** - it's **reliability and reusability**. Your notebook experiments become applications that work consistently for anyone, anywhere.

# Practice

**What does "engineering mindset" mean in the context of this course?**

a) Writing more complex code with advanced algorithms  
b) Using only the most cutting-edge programming languages  
c) Establishing workflows that separate research code from production-ready software  
d) Working only on large-scale distributed systems
