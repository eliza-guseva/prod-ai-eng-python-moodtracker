# Build MoodTracker App

#future_video

This is the first mini-course that is meant to be a part of a bigger journey — AI Engineering in Production, that (I hope) will teach you things that are often not covered in tutorials and introduction to AI online courses.

This whole journey — the series of the courses — is meant to be both structured and comprehensive. Meaning that we’ll begin in the beginning and will grow both our AI Engineering mindset and toolchain step by step until (hopefully) you feel well oriented in the AI Engineering world and can begin exploration on your own.

This course and courses after assume you have _some_ Python knowledge. But we will begin gently and slowly. So, if you forgot or just beginning your Python journey, you should be able to follow.

Often times when people are taught Python (especially if they are taught to use it with data, ML/AI), they are taught to use Google Colab or Jupyter notebooks etc. And there’s a value in it. A lot ML/AI research and data exploration _is_ done in Notebooks. There are many companies even deploy Notebooks into production!

But there’s also the whole world outside of Notebooks. This is the world of wider Python and engineering skills that will make you more flexible as an AI Engineer (skills and career-wise). Personally, I think, it is also more fun to be a part of that wider world. Notebooks are great for exploration and research. But engineering skills let you automate analyses, build applications others can use, and collaborate with software engineers.

### A little bit about the structure

This course is split into logically-complete sections and each section is split into mini-lessons.

My strong believe is that in order to learn _anything_ in the domain of engineering you absolutely need to get your hands dirty and build some stuff. So in every course we build an app together. In every section we build a meanigful part of that app. And after (nearly) every lesson you’ll have an opportunity to practice your skills.

>I am thinking about this course as a journey. You know, like a road trip, or a multi-day hike. We begin somewhere, we have the goal, we put miles, we enjoy the scenery :)
>
>And because none of the truly interesting journeys are truly linear, in the end of some lessons you'll have a choice of which lesson to go next. 
>You can choose between:
>- **Next lesson** -- next logical step in our journey
>- **Rest stop** -- a topic which explains some of the concepts that we are working with, but which might not be familiar to everyone.
>- **Scenic route** -- a perhaps more advanced section, which I personally find interesting and useful, but isn't necessary for the whole progression
>
>Don't worry, after every detour, I'll take back to the main path.
